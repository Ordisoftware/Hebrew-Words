## Frequently asked questions

#### What to do if the check update tells that the SSL certificate is wrong or expired?

The software verifies the validity of the certificate of the update server in addition to the SHA-512 checksum of the installation file before downloading and running it. This certificate is normally updated within the two months of its annual expiration and a new version is released. You can manually check the latest version available online in case of problem.

#### What to do if there is a problem with the display?

Use the refresh view action of the menu at the top.

#### The software sometimes runs slowly, is this normal?

Yes, because implementing features requires a lot of Windows resources that depend on the performance of the computer.
