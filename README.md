#### What to do if the check update tells that the SSL certificate is wrong or expired?

The software verifies the validity of the certificate of the update server in addition to the SHA-512 checksum of the installation file before downloading and running it.

You can manually check the latest version available online in case of problem.

#### What to do if the application does not work normally despite restoring settings?

Use the Start Menu link:

&emsp;`Ordisoftware\Hebrew Words\Reset Hebrew Words settings`

This will erase all settings as well as those of old versions, which should resolve issues if there is a conflict, otherwise please contact support.

#### What is the Windows double-buffering?

When enabled, this will speed up rendering of the main form when it is displayed, but it may cause a slight black flicker.

When disabled, top menu and some controls painting may cause latency, and dynamic items can be generated slowly the larger the number.

#### What to do if there is a problem with the display?

The refresh view button of the menu at the top redraws the entire form.

## Application Frequently asked questions

#### Why all verses of a chapter are not rendered?

Due to Windows Forms limitation, some chapters with too many verses cannot be fully rendered.

In this case, one verse at a time should be used.

List of chapters concerned:

- Bereshit 24 (67)
- Bamidbar 7 (89)
- Devarim 28 (69)
- Melakim I 8 (66)
- Tehilim 118 (176)

#### The software sometimes runs slowly, is this normal?

Yes, because implementing features requires a lot of Windows resources that depends on the performance of the computer.

In this case, one verse at a time should be used.

## Command-line options

- Change interface language (does not change the database content):

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe --lang [en|fr]`

- Enable or disable future functionalities preview:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --withpreview | --nopreview`

- Go to a reference like "1.1.1" or "bereshit 1.1" or "genesis/genèse 1.1":

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe --verse [reference]` 

- Search a word in the database using unicode "`בראשית`" and or hebrew font "`ty>arb`":

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe --word [word]` 

- Search a translation of a word in the database like "`elohim`":

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe --translated [word]` 

All diacritics and case are removed, and if the word can't be processed it is set to empty.

If any Hebrew Unicode chars is present, all non Unicode are removed, else Hebrew font chars are used and all non-font chars are removed.

These options can be used to control the software when it is already running, but if this case this only works for administrator users.

#### _How to open a verse reference from a selected sentence from any application such as browser or text editor?_

It is possible to use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) to define for example this `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + V` command on a selected reference:

```
!^+V::
  clipboardOld := ClipboardAll
  ControlGetFocus, ctrl
  Send, ^c
  sleep 100
  reference := StrReplace(Clipboard, A_Space, "%20")
  Clipboard := clipboardOld
  appPath := "C:\Program Files\Ordisoftware\Hebrew Words\Bin\"
  appExe := "Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe"
  cmdLine := appPath appExe " --verse " reference
  sleep 200
  Run %cmdLine%
  return 
```

#### _How to search a word from a selected unicode from any application such as browser or text editor?_

Also for example to use `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + S` :

```
!^+S::
  clipboardOld := ClipboardAll
  ControlGetFocus, ctrl
  Send, ^c
  sleep 100
  word := Clipboard
  Clipboard := clipboardOld
  appPath := "C:\Program Files\Ordisoftware\Hebrew Words\Bin\"
  appExe := "Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Words.exe"
  cmdLine := appPath appExe " --word " word
  sleep 200
  Run %cmdLine%
  return 
```
